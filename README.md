# MLB Salary Prediction Using Sabermetrics (DS606)

## Project Summary
We build models to predict MLB player contract value (e.g., Average Annual Value / salary) using player performance metrics and sabermetrics (e.g., WAR, OPS+).

## Research Questions
1. Can player performance metrics predict salary/contract value?
2. Which features (WAR, OPS+, age, HR, etc.) are most important?
3. Which model performs best (Linear/Lasso/Random Forest/Gradient Boosting)?

## Data
Sources: FanGraphs 
- `data/raw/`: original downloaded files
- `data/processed/`: cleaned/merged datasets used for modeling

## Methods (Planned)
- Data cleaning + feature engineering 
- EDA (distributions, correlations)
- Modeling: baseline + regression/ML models
- Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, R² with cross-validation

## Repo Structure
- `notebooks/`: EDA + modeling notebooks
- `src/`: helper scripts (data prep, modeling)
- `reports/figures/`: plots used in slides/report
- `slides/`: presentation files
